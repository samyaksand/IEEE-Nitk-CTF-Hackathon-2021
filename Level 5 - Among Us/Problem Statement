First locate the hidden file ".AmongUs.txt" using the **find** command.
In the directory containing this file, there are several " .txt" files of which one is an image
. Find that and open it using **eog**(or any other image viewer). 
It contains the first half of the key i.e. "ReD!mp0Ster" and gives you the directory where you can find the second half.
In this directory, there are two text files with 1001 random words each and only one word is common among the two. 
Find it using the **comm** command (remember to **sort** the words in each file). That is the second half of the key i.e. "aquamarineblue". 
Concatenate the two halves to get the flag.

All the bolded words (** **) are linux commands. Use "man <command> " to understand how the commands work.
