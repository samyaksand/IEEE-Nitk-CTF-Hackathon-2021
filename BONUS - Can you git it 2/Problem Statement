Currently, you are on main branch and on using command "git checkout new", it takes you to the branch named "new". 
On doing "git log" (this shows all the commits made on that branch)  to see all the commits. 

Using "git checkout <commit hash>" (commit hash is the number in log, see the git resources provided for more details) to checkout/go to the commit which has the comment "You git this".
On doing "ls -al", you can view all the files. Unzip the hidden zip file and enter into the "key" directory. 
Then again repeating "git log" and "git checkout <commit-hash>, checkout to the commit with the name "WYA". 
Then on running the strings command on the "Prog" file, you get the flag.
